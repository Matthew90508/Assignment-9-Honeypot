# Assignment 9-Honeypot
Codepath week 9

Create a repository on Github with a README.md that includes a brief writeup about your experiment. Include the following details:

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed? 
-Dionaea - mhn-honeypot-1

Any issues you encountered? 
-Initially I was recieving an error during the first firewall step along the lines of "precondition not met, billing not enabled." I eventually figured out the problem and created a billing account and linked it to the appropriate project. Later on when you first had to ssh into the external ip, it kept failing to connect. Awhile later, I learned http wasn't enabled and after enabling the protocol it worked just fine.

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
